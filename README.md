Below is only documented on how to launch the application.

---

To run the server:

Go to the Github repository on your local machine with the console/terminal:

```
cd foldername/
```

When your in the Github repository do the following:

```
cd mysite/
```

Because MacOS has python 2.7 installed out of factory, you will need to specify which python version you want to start by adding the version behind it. When running python 3.X use "python3" and when using python 2.X, you can use just "python" or specify it with "python2". If you did the basic install with the Django installer, it will be installed under Python  3.X , so you will need to use the "python3" command.

Then run the following command to start the server:

```
MacOS: python3 manage.py runserver
```

```
Other: python manage.py runserver
```

Then you can go to any of these links, depending how far you progressed in through the DjangoTutorial:
